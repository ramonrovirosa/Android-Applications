HW Assignment #5
CS185


This was a fun asignment. The hardest part was understanding matrix translations. I had a hard time coordinating the translation for drawing the circles and moving/rotating since the circle drawing occurs in the onDraw method and scaling/translation happens in the ontouch method. 


Suggestion, you do not specify in this assignment about saving state when the user changes from vertical to horizontal orientation. Next year I would suggest adding to the assignment locking the screen alignment so the screen cannot be rotated, and therefore the state be lost.


I did not attempt extra credit.
