Approach:I take into account the average most optimal way to enter in the data. There are four variants for this problem: Both teams score 3 digit points, both teams score 2 digit points, 1 team scores 2 digit points & 1 scores 3 digit points, So I chose the scenario where 1 team scores 2 digit points & 1 scores 3 digit points as the average case scenario. For the keep scores 1s app that we had to analyze I assumed that the score +/1 input boxes where not wheel, as a keyboard came up when you taped on them. I also assumed that the team name picker was a wheel since you could scroll through it to find your team. 


Problems:
Working with fragments was a little frustrating at first, but I found a lot of help from other peoples questions on stack-overflow.com. One suggestion would be that instead of just images, next year including a video of the events necessary in order to get a better idea of how the application should run. It can be hard at times to get an idea of the application just from images.


Results:
The results for my first KLM analysis on the app that I had to implement, I found that on average it takes a total of 53.7 seconds to enter a score for a team.


The results for my second KLM analysis on the app that came already made for us in a pkg file, KLM analysis 2, I found took on average 45.9 seconds and was faster.


So my final analysis is that the KeepScores1s app that was given to us to analyze was faster than the app, SportsScores which we had to implement by about 7.8 seconds.
