Assignment 2


For this assignment, I mainly went through, in detail the hello world tutorial on the android google developer page, and the programmatic example given in class. For resources, I found it very helpful to google any questions, and resources were easily found on StackOverflow.com. The only trouble I had was that there are so many different ways to do everything, so at times it can be hard to choose how to proceed with doing something.


I did not use the UI builder as I found it more difficult to understand what I was doing than entering in the xml code. I did not face any major roadblocks and everything is complete. f
