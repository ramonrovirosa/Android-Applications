I enjoyed this project, and followed the steps in order. I thought it was very easy to get help from the slides and stack overflow online. The hardest part was initially setting up the environment and getting everything to compile correctly. 


Only suggestion for improvement is to have a better tutorial for doing a student t-test with more specific instructions.


I did not attempt extra credit.
